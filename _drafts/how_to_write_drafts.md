Creating drafts is exteremely easy with Jekyll. All you have to do is put 
your drafts in the `_drafts` folder and you can still check them into 
source control. 

If you want to view those drafts, just run Jekyll with the `--drafts` option. 
For example, `jekyll build --drafts` or `jekyll serve --drafts`.
